# Homework 3 Dynamic Memory Allocator

We **HIGHLY** suggest that you read this entire document, the book chapter,
and examine the base code prior to beginning. If you do not read the entire
document before beginning, you may find yourself doing extra work.

# Introduction

You must read **Chapter 9.9 Dynamic Memory Allocation Page 839** before
starting this assignment. This chapter contains all the theoretical
information needed to complete this assignment. Since the textbook has
sufficient information about the different design strategies and
implementation details of an allocator, this document will not cover this
information. Instead, it will refer you to the necessary sections and pages in
the textbook.

## Takeaways

After completing this assignment, you will have a better understanding of:
* The inner workings of a dynamic memory allocator
* Memory padding and alignment
* Structs and linked lists in C
* [errno](https://linux.die.net/man/3/errno) numbers in C
* Unit testing in C

# Overview

You will create an allocator for the x86-64 architecture with the following features:

- Free lists segregated by size class, using first-fit policy within each size class,
  augmented with a set of "quick lists" holding small blocks segregated by size.
- Immediate coalescing of large blocks on free with adjacent free blocks;
  delayed coalescing on free of small blocks.
- Boundary tags to support efficient coalescing, with footer optimization that allows
    footers to be omitted from allocated blocks.
- Block splitting without creating splinters.
- Allocated blocks aligned to "single memory row" (8-byte) boundaries.
- Free lists maintained using **last in first out (LIFO)** discipline.
- Use of a prologue and epilogue to achieve required alignment and avoid edge cases
    at the end of the heap.

You will implement your own versions of the **malloc**, **realloc**,
**free**, and **memalign** functions.

You will use existing Criterion unit tests and write your own to help debug
your implementation.

## Free List Management Policy

Your allocator **MUST** use the following scheme to manage free blocks:
Free blocks will be stored in a fixed array of `NUM_FREE_LISTS` free lists,
segregated by size class (see **Chapter 9.9.14 Page 863** for a discussion
of segregated free lists).
Each individual free list will be organized as a **circular, doubly linked list**
(more information below).
The size classes are based on a power-of-two geometric sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...),
according to the following scheme:
The first free list (at index 0) holds blocks of the minimum size `M`
(where `M = 32` for this assignment).
The second list (at index 1) holds blocks of size `(M, 2M]`.
The third list (at index 2) holds blocks of size `(2M, 4M]`.
The fourth list holds blocks whose size is in the interval `(4M, 8M]`.
The fifth list holds blocks whose size is in the interval `(8M, 16M]`,
and so on.  This pattern continues up to the interval `(128M, 256M]`,
and then the last list (at index `NUM_FREE_LISTS-1`; *i.e.* 9)
holds blocks of size greater than `256M`.
Allocation requests will be satisfied by searching the free lists in increasing
order of size class.

## Quick Lists

Besides the main free lists, you are also to use additional "quick lists" as a temporary
repository for recently freed small blocks.  There are a fixed number of quick lists,
which are organized as singly linked lists accessed in LIFO fashion.  Each quick lists
holds small blocks of one particular size.  The first quick list holds blocks of the
minimum size (32 bytes).
The second quick list holds blocks of the minimum size plus the alignment size
(32+8 = 40 bytes).  This third quick list holds blocks of size 32+8+8 = 48 bytes,
and so on.  When a small block is freed, it is inserted at the front of the corresponding
quick list, where it can quickly be found to satisfy a subsequent request for a block
of that same size.  The capacity of each quick list is limited; if insertion of a block
would exceed the capacity of the quick list, then the list is "flushed" and the existing
blocks in the quick list are removed from the quick list and added to the main free list,
after coalescing, if possible.

## Block Placement Policy

When allocating memory, use a **segregated fits policy**, modified by the use of quick lists
as follows.  When an allocation request is received, the quick list containing blocks of the
appropriate size is first checked to try to quickly obtain a block of exactly the right size.
If there is no quick list of that size (quick lists are only maintained for a fixed set of
the smallest block sizes), or if there is a quick list but it is empty, then the request will
be satisfied from the main free lists.

Satisfying a request from the main free lists is accomplished as follows:
First, the smallest size class that is sufficiently large to satisfy the request
is determined.  The free lists are then searched, starting from the list for the
determined size class and continuing in increasing order of size, until a nonempty
list is found.  The request is then satisfied by the first block in that list
that is sufficiently large; *i.e.* a **first-fit policy**
(discussed in **Chapter 9.9.7 Page 849**) is applied within each individual free list.

If there is no exact match for an allocation request in the quick lists, and there
is no block in the main free lists that is large enough to satisfy the allocation request,
`sf_mem_grow` should be called to extend the heap by an additional page of memory.
After coalescing this page with any free block that immediately precedes it, you should
attempt to use the resulting block of memory to satisfy the allocation request;
splitting it if it is too large and no splinter would result.  If the block of
memory is still not large enough, another call to `sf_mem_grow` should be made;
continuing to grow the heap until either a large enough block is obtained or the return
value from `sf_mem_grow` indicates that there is no more memory.

As discussed in the book, segregated free lists allow the allocator to approximate a
best-fit policy, with lower overhead than would be the case if an exact best-fit policy
were implemented.  The rationale for the use of quick lists is that when a small block
are freed, it is likely that there will soon be another allocation request for a block
of that same size.  By putting the block in a quick list, it can be re-used for such
a request without the overhead of coalescing and/or splitting that would be required
if the block were inserted back into the main pool.

## Splitting Blocks & Splinters

Your allocator must split blocks at allocation time to reduce the amount of
internal fragmentation.  Details about this feature can be found in **Chapter 9.9.8 Page 849**.
Due to alignment and overhead constraints, there will be a minimum useful block size
that the allocator can support.  **For this assignment, pointers returned by the allocator
in response to allocation requests are required to be aligned to 8-byte boundaries**;
*i.e.* the pointers returned will be addresses that are multiples of 2^3.
The 8-byte alignment requirement implies that the minimum block size for your allocator
will be 32 bytes.  No "splinters" of smaller size than this are ever to be created.
If splitting a block to be allocated would result in a splinter, then the block should
not be split; rather, the block should be used as-is to satisfy the allocation request
(*i.e.*, you will "over-allocate" by issuing a block slightly larger than that required).

> :thinking: How do the alignment and overhead requirements constrain the minimum block size?
> As you read more details about the format of a block header, block footer, and alignment requirements,
> you should try to answer this question.

## Freeing a Block

When a block is freed, if it is a small block it is inserted at the front of the quick list of the
appropriate size.  Blocks in the quick lists are free, but the allocation bit remains set in
the header to prevent them from being coalesced with adjacent blocks.  In addition, there is a
separate "in quick list" bit in the block header that is set for blocks in the quick lists,
to allow them to be readily distinguished from blocks that are actually allocated.
To avoid arbitrary growth of the quick lists, the capacity of each is limited to `QUICK_LIST_MAX` blocks.
If an attempt is made to insert a block into a quick list that is already at capacity,
the quick list is *flushed* by removing each of the blocks it currently contains and adding
them back into the main free lists, coalescing them with any adjacent free blocks as described
below.  After flushing the quick list, the block currently being freed is inserted into the
now-empty list, leaving just one block in that list.

When a block is freed and added into the main free lists, an attempt should first be made to
**coalesce** the block with any free block that immediately precedes or follows it in the heap.
(See **Chapter 9.9.10 Page 850** for a discussion of the coalescing procedure.)
Once the block has been coalesced, it should be inserted at the **front** of the free
list for the appropriate size class (based on the size after coalescing).
The reason for performing coalescing is to combat the external fragmentation
that would otherwise result due to the splitting of blocks upon allocation.
Note that blocks inserted into quick lists are not immediately coalesced; they are only
coalesced at such later time as the quick list is flushed and the blocks are moved into the
main free lists.  This is an example of a "deferred coalescing" strategy.

## Block Headers & Footers

In **Chapter 9.9.6 Page 847 Figure 9.35**, a block header is defined as 2 words
(32 bits) to hold the block size and allocated bit. In this assignment, the header
will be 4 words (i.e. 64 bits or 1 memory row). The header fields will be similar
to those in the textbook but you will maintain an extra bit for recording whether
or not the previous block is allocated, and an extra bit for recording whether or not
the block is currently in a quick list.
Each free block will also have a footer, which occupies the last memory row of the block.
The footer of a free block contains exactly the same information as the header.
In an allocated block, the footer is not present, and the space that it would otherwise
occupy may be used for payload.

**Block Header Format:**
```c
    +------------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+---------+ <- header
    |                                       block_size           |in qklst|prv alloc|  alloc  |
    |                                  (3 LSB's implicitly 0)    | (0/1)  |  (0/1)  |  (0/1)  | 
    |                                        (1 row)             | 1 bit  |  1 bit  |  1 bit  |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+---------+ <- (aligned)
```

- The `block_size` field gives the number of bytes for the **entire** block (including header/footer,
  payload, and padding).  It occupies the entire 64 bits of the block header or footer,
  except that the three least-significant bits of the block size, which would normally always
  be zero due to alignment requirements, are used to store additional information.
  This means that these bits have to be masked when retrieving the block size from the header and
  when the block size is stored in the header the previously existing values of these bits have
  to be preserved.
- The `alloc` bit (bit 0, mask 0x1) is a boolean. It is 1 if the block is allocated and 0 if it is free.
- The `prev_alloc` (bit 1, mask 0x2) is also a boolean. It is 1 if the **immediately preceding** block
  in the heap is allocated and 0 if it is not.
- The `in_qklst` (bit 2, mask 0x4) is also a boolean. It is 1 if the block is currently in a quick list,
  and 0 if it is not.  Note that if this bit is a 1, then the `alloc` bit will also be a 1.

Each free block will also have a footer, which occupies the last memory row of the block.
The footer of a free block (including a block in a quick list) must contain exactly the
same information as the header.  In an allocated block, the footer will not be present,
and the space that it would otherwise occupy may be used for payload.

The `lib` folder contains the object file for the `sfutil` library. This
library provides you with several functions to aid you with the implementation
of your allocator. <span style="color:red">**Do NOT delete this file as it
is an essential part of your homework assignment.**</span>

The provided `Makefile` creates object files from the `.c` files in the `src`
directory, places the object files inside the `build` directory, and then links
the object files together, including `lib/sfutil.o`, to make executables that
are stored to the `bin` directory.

**Note:** `make clean` will not delete `sfutil.o` or the `lib` folder, but it
will delete all other contained `.o` files.

The `sfmm.h` header file contains function prototypes and defines the format
of the various data structures that you are to use.

All functions for your allocator (`sf_malloc`, `sf_free`, `sf_realloc`,
and `sf_memalign`)
**must** be implemented in `src/sfmm.c`.

The program in `src/main.c` contains a basic example of using the allocation functions.
Running `make` will create a `sfmm` executable in the `bin` directory. This can be run
using the command `bin/sfmm`.

# Allocation Functions

You will implement the four functions (`sf_malloc`, `sf_realloc`, `sf_free`,
and `sf_memalign`)
in the file `src/sfmm.c`.  The file `include/sfmm.h` contains the prototypes and
documentation shown below.

**Note:** Standard C library functions set `errno` when there is an error.
To avoid conflicts with these functions, your allocation functions will set `sf_errno`,
a variable declared as `extern` in `sfmm.h`.

```c
/*
 * This is your implementation of sf_malloc. It acquires uninitialized memory that
 * is aligned and padded properly for the underlying system.
 *
 * @param size The number of bytes requested to be allocated.
 *
 * @return If size is 0, then NULL is returned without setting sf_errno.
 * If size is nonzero, then if the allocation is successful a pointer to a valid region of
 * memory of the requested size is returned.  If the allocation is not successful, then
 * NULL is returned and sf_errno is set to ENOMEM.
 */
void *sf_malloc(size_t size);

/*
 * Resizes the memory pointed to by ptr to size bytes.
 *
 * @param ptr Address of the memory region to resize.
 * @param size The minimum size to resize the memory to.
 *
 * @return If successful, the pointer to a valid region of memory is
 * returned, else NULL is returned and sf_errno is set appropriately.
 *
 *   If sf_realloc is called with an invalid pointer sf_errno should be set to EINVAL.
 *   If there is no memory available sf_realloc should set sf_errno to ENOMEM.
 *
 * If sf_realloc is called with a valid pointer and a size of 0 it should free
 * the allocated block and return NULL without setting sf_errno.
 */
void* sf_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

/*
 * Marks a dynamically allocated region as no longer in use.
 * Adds the newly freed block to the free list.
 *
 * @param ptr Address of memory returned by the function sf_malloc.
 *
 * If ptr is invalid, the function calls abort() to exit the program.
 */
void sf_free(void *ptr);

/*
 * Allocates a block of memory with a specified alignment.
 *
 * @param align The alignment required of the returned pointer.
 * @param size The number of bytes requested to be allocated.
 *
 * @return If align is not a power of two or is less than the default alignment (8),
 * then NULL is returned and sf_errno is set to EINVAL.
 * If size is 0, then NULL is returned without setting sf_errno.
 * Otherwise, if the allocation is successful a pointer to a valid region of memory
 * of the requested size and with the requested alignment is returned.
 * If the allocation is not successful, then NULL is returned and sf_errno is set
 * to ENOMEM.
 */
void *sf_memalign(size_t size, size_t align);

# Initialization Functions

In the `lib` directory, we have provided you with the `sfutil.o` object file.
When linked with your program, this object file allows you to access the
`sfutil` library, which contains the following functions:

```c
/*
 * @return The starting address of the heap for your allocator.
 */
void *sf_mem_start();

/*
 * @return The ending address of the heap for your allocator.
 */
void *sf_mem_end();

/*

 */
void *sf_mem_grow();

/* The size of a page of memory returned by sf_mem_grow(). */
#define PAGE_SZ 4096
```

# sf_mem_grow

The function `sf_mem_grow` is to be invoked by `sf_malloc`, at the time of the
first allocation request to obtain an initial free block, and on subsequent allocations
when a large enough block to satisfy the request is not found.
For this assignment, your implementation **MUST ONLY** use `sf_mem_grow` to
extend the heap.  **DO NOT** use any system calls such as **brk** or **sbrk**
to do this.

Function `sf_mem_grow` returns memory to your allocator in pages.
Each page is 4096 bytes (4 KB) and there are a limited, small number of pages
available (the actual number may vary, so do not hard-code any particular limit
into your program).  Each call to `sf_mem_grow` extends the heap by one page and
returns a pointer to the new page (this will be the same pointer as would have
been obtained from `sf_mem_end` before the call to `sf_mem_grow`.

The `sf_mem_grow` function also keeps track of the starting and ending addresses
of the heap for you. You can get these addresses through the `sf_mem_start` and
`sf_mem_end` functions.

# Implementation Details

## Memory Row Size

The table below lists the sizes of data types (following Intel standard terminlogy)
on x86-64 Linux Mint:

| C declaration | Data type | x86-64 Size (Bytes) |
| :--------------: | :----------------: | :----------------------: |
| char  | Byte | 1 |
| short | Word | 2 |
| int   | Double word | 4 |
| long int | Quadword | 8 |
| unsigned long | Quadword | 8 |
| pointer | Quadword | 8 |
| float | Single precision | 4 |
| double | Double precision | 8 |
| long double | Extended precision | 16

> :nerd: You can find these sizes yourself using the sizeof operator.
> For example, `printf("%lu\n", sizeof(int))` prints 4.

In this assignment we will assume that each "memory row" is 8 bytes (64 bits) in size.
All pointers returned by your `sf_malloc` are to be 8-byte aligned; that is, they will be
addresses that are multiples of 8.  This requirement permits such pointers to be used to
store any of the basic machine data types up to 8 bytes in width in a "naturally aligned" fashion.
A value stored in memory is said to be *naturally aligned* if the address at which it
is stored is a multiple of the size of the value.  For example, an `int` value is
naturally aligned when stored at an address that is a multiple of 4.  A `double` value
is naturally aligned when stored at an address that is a multiple of 8.
Keeping values naturally aligned in memory is a hardware-imposed requirement for some
architectures, and improves the efficiency of memory access in other architectures.

## Block Header & Footer Fields

The various header and footer formats are specified in `include/sfmm.h`:

    +------------------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+---------+

    NOTE: For a free block, footer contents must always be identical to header contents.
```

The `sfmm.h` header file contains C structure definitions corresponding to the above diagrams:

```c
#define THIS_BLOCK_ALLOCATED  0x1
#define PREV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED  0x2
#define IN_QUICK_LIST         0x4

typedef size_t sf_header;
typedef size_t sf_footer;

/*
 * Structure of a block.
 */
typedef struct sf_block {
    sf_header header;
    union {
        /* A free block contains links to other blocks in a free list. */
        struct {
            struct sf_block *next;
            struct sf_block *prev;
        } links;
        /* An allocated block contains a payload (aligned), starting here. */
        char payload[0];   // Length varies according to block size.
    } body;
    // Depending on whether the block is allocated or free, and on whether footer optimization
    // is in use, a block might have a footer at the end, either overlapping the payload area
    // or in addition to it.  Since the payload size is not known at compile-time, we can't
    // declare the footer here as a field of the struct but instead have to compute its location
    // at run time.
} sf_block;
```

For `sf_block`, the `body` field is a `union`, which has been used to emphasize
the difference between the information contained in a free block and that contained
in an allocated block.  If the block is free, then its `body` has a `links` field,
which is a `struct` containing `next` and `prev` pointers.  If the block is
allocated, then its `body` does not have a `links` field, but rather has a `payload`,
which starts at the same address that the `links` field would have started if the
block were free.  The size of the `payload` is obviously not zero, but as it is
variable and only determined at run time, the `payload` field has been declared
to be an array of length 0 just to enable the use of `bp->body.payload` to obtain
a pointer to the payload area, if `bp` is a pointer to `sf_block`.

When a block is free, it must have a valid footer whose contents are identical to the
header contents.  We will use a "footer optimization" technique that permits a footer
to be omitted from allocated blocks; thereby making the space that would otherwise
be occupied by the footer available for use by payload.  The footer optimization
technique involves maintaining a bit in the header of each block that can be checked
to find out if the immediately preceding block is allocated or free.
If the preceding block is free, then its footer can be examined to find out its
size and then the size can be used to calculate the block's starting address for the
purpose of performing coalescing.
If the preceding block is **not** free, then it has no footer, but as we can only
coalesce with a free block there is no need for the information that we would have
found in the footer, anyway.

## Quick List and Free List Heads

In the file `include/sfmm.h`, you will see the following declarations:

```c
#define NUM_QUICK_LISTS 20  /* Number of quick lists. */
#define QUICK_LIST_MAX   5  /* Maximum number of blocks permitted on a single quick list. */

struct {
    int length;             // Number of blocks currently in the list.
    struct sf_block *first; // Pointer to first block in the list.
} sf_quick_lists[NUM_QUICK_LISTS];

#define NUM_FREE_LISTS 10
struct sf_block sf_free_list_heads[NUM_FREE_LISTS];
```

The array `sf_quick_lists` gives the heads of the quick lists, of which there
are a total of `NUM_QUICK_LISTS`.   At index 0 in this array is the head of the
quick list for blocks of the minimum block size `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE`, and for each
successive entry in the array the block size increases by the alignment granularity of 8.
The `sf_quick_lists` array therefore has space for the heads of `NUM_QUICK_LISTS`
quick lists, with sizes ranging from `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE` to
`MIN_BLOCK_SIZE + (NUM_QUICK_LISTS-1) * 8`, in increments of 8.
Besides giving a pointer `first` to the first block in a quick list,
each entry of `sf_quick_lists` contains a `length` field that is to be kept
updated with the current length of the list headed by that entry.
In contrast to the main free list, the quick lists are maintained as
**singly linked lists** accessed in LIFO fashion (*i.e.* like stacks).
When a block is in a quick list, only its `next` pointer is used.  Double linking
is not needed, because entries are only ever added or removed at the front of a list.
The capacity of each quick list is limited to a maximum of `QUICK_LIST_MAX` blocks.
Inserting into a quick list that is at capacity causes the quick list to be flushed
as discussed elsewhere.

The array `sf_free_list_heads` contains the heads of the main free lists,
of which there are a total of `NUM_FREE_LISTS`.
These lists are maintained as **circular, doubly linked lists**.
Each node in a free list contains a `next` pointer that points to the next
node in the list, and a `prev` pointer that points the previous node.
For each index `i` with `0 <= i < NUM_FREE_LISTS` the variable `sf_free_list_head[i]`
is a dummy, "sentinel" node, which is used to connect the beginning and the end of
the list at index `i`.  This sentinel node is always present and (aside from its `next`
and `free` pointers) does **not** contain any other data.  If the list is empty,
then the fields `sf_freelist_heads[i].body.links.next` and `sf_freelist_heads[i].body.links.prev`
both contain `&sf_freelist_heads[i]` (*i.e.* the sentinel node points back to itself).
If the list is nonempty, then `sf_freelist_heads[i].body.links.next` points to the
first node in the list and `sf_freelist_heads[i].body.links.prev` points to the
last node in the list.
Inserting into and deleting from a circular doubly linked list is done
in the usual way, except that, owing to the use of the sentinel, there
are no edge cases for inserting or removing at the beginning or the end
of the list.
If you need a further introduction to this data structure, you can readily
find information on it by googling ("circular doubly linked lists with sentinel").

## Overall Structure of the Heap

The overall structure of the allocatable area of your heap will be a sequence of allocated
and free blocks.
Your heap should also contain a prologue and epilogue (as described in the book, **page 855**)
to arrange for the proper block alignment and to avoid edge cases when coalescing blocks.
The overall organization of the heap is as shown below:

```c

    |                                                                                         |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                                         |
    |                       Unused (will become header when heap grows)                       |
    |                                        (1 row)                                          |

                                                                                                   (aligned)
```

The heap begins with unused "padding", so that the header of each block will start
`sizeof(sf_header)` bytes before an alignment boundary.
The first block of the heap is the "prologue", which is an allocated block of minimum
size with an unused payload area.

At the end of the heap is an "epilogue", which consists only of an allocated header,
with block size set to 0.
The prologue and epilogue are never used to satisfy allocation requests and they
are never freed.
Whenever the heap is extended, a new epilogue is created at the end of the
newly added region and the old epilogue becomes the header of the new block.
This is as described in the book.

We do not make any separate C structure definitions for the prologue and epilogue.
They can be manipulated using the existing `sf_block` structure, though care must be taken
not to access fields that are not valid for these special blocks
(*i.e.* anything other than `header` for the epilogue).

As your heap is initially empty, at the time of the first call to `sf_malloc`
you will need to make one call to `sf_mem_grow` to obtain a page of memory
within which to set up the prologue and initial epilogue.
The remainder of the memory in this first page should then be inserted into
the free list as a single block.

## Notes on sf_malloc

When implementing your `sf_malloc` function, first determine if the request size
is 0.  If so, then return `NULL` without setting `sf_errno`.
If the request size is non-zero, then you should determine the size of the
block to be allocated by adding the header size and the size of any necessary
padding to reach a size that is a multiple of 8 to maintain proper alignment.
Remember also that the block has to be big enough to store the footer
as well as the `next` and `prev` pointers when the block is free.
As these fields are not present in an allocated block this space can (and should)
be overlapped with the payload area.
As has already been discussed, the above constraints lead to a minimum block size
of 32 bytes, so you should not attempt to allocate any block smaller than this.
After having determined the required block size, you should first check the
quick lists to see if they contain a block of that size.
If they do not, you should determine the index of the first main free list
that would be able to satisfy a request of that size.
Search that free list from the beginning until the first sufficiently large
block is found.  If there is no such block, continue with the next larger
size class.
If a big enough block is found, then after splitting it (if it will not leave
a splinter), you should insert the remainder part back into the appropriate
freelist.  When splitting a block, the "lower part" (lower-valued addresses)
should be used to satisfy the allocation request and the "upper part"
(higher-valued addresses) should become the remainder.
Do not insert this remainder portion into any quick list; it should be put
directly into the main free lists.

If a big enough block is not found in any of the freelists, then you
must use `sf_mem_grow` to request more memory
(for requests larger than a page, more than one such call might be required).
If your allocator ultimately cannot satisfy the request, your `sf_malloc` function
must set `sf_errno` to `ENOMEM` and return `NULL`.

### Notes on sf_mem_grow

After each call to `sf_mem_grow`, you must attempt to coalesce the newly
allocated page with any free block immediately preceding it, in order to build
blocks larger than one page.  Insert the new block at the beginning of
the appropriate main freelist (*not* a quick list).

**Note:** Do not coalesce past the beginning or end of the heap.

## Notes on sf_free

When implementing `sf_free`, you must first verify that the pointer being
passed to your function belongs to an allocated block. This can be done by
examining the fields in the block header.  In this assignment, we will consider
the following cases to be invalid pointers:

- The pointer is `NULL`.
- The pointer is not 8-byte aligned.
- The block size is less than the minimum block size of 32.
- The block size is not a multiple of 8
- The header of the block is before the start of the first block of the heap,
  or the footer of the block is after the end of the last block in the heap.
- The `allocated` bit in the header is 0.
- The `in quick list` bit in the header is 1.
- The `prev_alloc` field in the header is 0, indicating that the previous
  block is free, but the `alloc` field of the previous block header is not 0.

If an invalid pointer is passed to your function, you must call `abort` to exit
the program.  Use the man page for the `abort` function to learn more about this.

After confirming that a valid pointer was given, you must free the block.
If the block size matches the size of one of the quick lists, it should be
inserted into that quick list, flushing the quick list first if it is already
at capacity.  Otherwise, the block is inserted at the *front* of the appropriate
main free list, after coalescing with any adjacent free block.

Note that blocks in a main free list must **not** be marked as allocated,
and they must have a valid footer with contents identical to the block header.
In contrast, blocks in a quick list **are** marked as allocated, and they
do not have any footer.

# Notes on sf_realloc

When implementing your `sf_realloc` function, you must first verify that the
pointer passed to your function is valid. The criteria for pointer validity
are the same as those described in the 'Notes on sf_free' section above.
If the pointer is valid but the size parameter is 0, free the block and return `NULL`.

After verifying the parameters, consider the cases described below.
Note that in some cases, `sf_realloc` is more complicated than calling `sf_malloc`
to allocate more memory, `memcpy` to move the old memory to the new memory, and
`sf_free` to free the old memory.

## Reallocating to a Larger Size

When reallocating to a larger size, always follow these three steps:

1. Call `sf_malloc` to obtain a larger block.

2. Call `memcpy` to copy the data in the block given by the client to the block
returned by `sf_malloc`.  Be sure to copy the entire payload area, but no more.

3. Call `sf_free` on the block given by the client (inserting into a quick list
or main freelist and coalescing if required).

4. Return the block given to you by `sf_malloc` to the client.

If `sf_malloc` returns `NULL`, `sf_realloc` must also return `NULL`. Note that
you do not need to set `sf_errno` in `sf_realloc` because `sf_malloc` should
take care of this.

## Reallocating to a Smaller Size

When reallocating to a smaller size, your allocator must use the block that was
passed by the caller.  You must attempt to split the returned block. There are
two cases for splitting:

- Splitting the returned block results in a splinter. In this case, do not
split the block. Leave the splinter in the block, update the header field
if necessary, and return the same block back to the caller.

**Example:**

<pre>
            b                                               b
+----------------------+                       +------------------------+
| allocated            |                       |   allocated.           |
| Blocksize: 64 bytes  |   sf_realloc(b, 32)   |   Block size: 64 bytes |
| payload: 48 bytes    |                       |   payload: 32 bytes    |
|                      |                       |                        |
|                      |                       |                        |
+----------------------+                       +------------------------+
</pre>

In the example above, splitting the block would have caused a 24-byte splinter.
Therefore, the block is not split.

- The block can be split without creating a splinter. In this case, split the
block and update the block size fields in both headers.  Free the remainder block
by inserting it into the appropriate free list (after coalescing, if possible --
do not insert the remainder block into a quick list).
Return a pointer to the payload of the now-smaller block to the caller.

Note that in both of these sub-cases, you return a pointer to the same block
that was given to you.

**Example:**

<pre>
            b                                              b
+----------------------+                       +------------------------+
| allocated            |                       | allocated |  free      |
| Blocksize: 128 bytes |   sf_realloc(b, 50)   | 64 bytes  |  64 bytes. |
| payload: 80 bytes    |                       | payload:  |            |
|                      |                       | 50 bytes  | goes into  |
|                      |                       |           | free list  |
+----------------------+                       +------------------------+
</pre>

## Notes on sf_memalign

The `sf_memalign` function permits the caller to request a region of memory that
satisfies a more restrictive alignment requirement than the default 32-byte
alignment.  Such a facility is sometimes required in system programming; for example,
if the memory address returned by the allocator is to be given to an I/O device
that is only capable of accessing memory regions with alignments greater than the
default.

When `sf_memalign` is called, it must check that the requested alignment is at
least as large as the default alignment (8 bytes, for this assignment).
It must also check that the requested alignment is a power of two.  If either of
these tests fail, `sf_errno` should be set to `EINVAL` and `sf_memalign` should return `NULL`.
If these tests pass, then `sf_memalign` should treat the requested size in the
say way as for `malloc`.

In order to obtain memory with the requested alignment, `sf_memalign` allocates
a larger block than requested.  Specifically, it attempts to allocate a block
whose size is at least the requested size, plus the alignment size, plus the minimum
block size, plus the size required for a block header and footer.  A block of this size
will have the following property: either the normal payload address of the block
will satisfy the requested alignment (in which case nothing further need be done),
or else there will be a larger address within the block that satisfies the requested
alignment, has sufficient space after it to hold the requested size payload,
and in addition is sufficiently far from the beginning of the block that the initial
portion of the block can itself be split off into a block of at least minimum size
and freed:

<pre>
     large block
+-------------------------+                    +----+--------------------+
|                         |                    |    |                    |
|                         |    split 1         |    |                    |
| hdr                 ftr |      ==>           |free|hdr payload     ftr |
|                         |                    |  1 |    ^               |
|                         |                    |    |    |               |
+---------+---------------+                    +----+----+---------------+
        aligned                                          aligned
</pre>

Once any initial portion of the block has been split off and freed, if the block
is still too large for the requested size then it is subjected to splitting in
the normal way (*i.e.* as in `malloc`) and the unused remainder is freed.

<pre>
+----+--------------------+                    +----+---------------+----+
|    |                    |                    |    |               |    |
|    |                    |                    |    |allocated block|    |
|free|hdr payload     ftr |   split 2          |free|hdr payload ftr|free|
|  1 |    ^               |     ==>            |  1 |    ^          |  2 |
|    |    |               |                    |    |    |          |    |
+----+----+---------------+                    +----+----+----------+----+
          aligned                                        aligned
</pre>

# Helper Functions

The `sfutil` library additionally contains the following helper functions,
which should be self explanatory.  They all output to `stderr`.

```c
void sf_show_block(sf_block *bp);
void sf_show_free_list(int index);
void sf_show_free_lists();
void sf_show_quick_list(int index);
void sf_show_quick_lists();
void sf_show_heap();
```

We have provided these functions to help you visualize your free lists and
allocated blocks.

# Unit Testing

For this assignment, we will use Criterion to test your allocator. We have
provided a basic set of test cases and you will have to write your own as well.

You will use the Criterion framework alongside the provided helper functions to
ensure your allocator works exactly as specified.

In the `tests/sfmm_tests.c` file, there are ten unit test examples. These tests
check for the correctness of `sf_malloc`, `sf_realloc`, and `sf_free`.
We provide some basic assertions, but by no means are they exhaustive.  It is your
job to ensure that your header/footer bits are set correctly and that blocks are
allocated/freed as specified.

## Compiling and Running Tests

When you compile your program with `make`, a `sfmm_tests` executable will be
created in the `bin` folder alongside the `main` executable. This can be run
with `bin/sfmm_tests`. To obtain more information about each test run, you can
use the verbose print option: `bin/sfmm_tests --verbose`.
You might also find it helpful to suppress the running of tests concurrently
by giving the `--j1` option.
It is also possible to restrict the set of tests that are run.  For example,
using `--filter suite_name/test_name` will only run the test named `test_name`
in test suite `suite_name` (if there is such a test, otherwise it will run
no tests).

# Writing Criterion Tests

The first test `malloc_an_int` tests `sf_malloc`.
It allocates space for an integer and assigns a value to that space.
It then runs an assertion to make sure that the space returned by `sf_malloc`
was properly assigned.

```c
cr_assert(*x == 4, "sf_malloc failed to give proper space for an int!");
```

The string after the assertion only gets printed to the screen if the assertion
failed (i.e. `*x != 4`). However, if there is a problem before the assertion,
such as a SEGFAULT, the unit test will print the error to the screen and
continue to run the rest of the unit tests.

# A Word to the Wise

This program will be very difficult to get working unless you are
extremely disciplined about your coding style.  Think carefully about how
to modularize your code in a way that makes it easier to understand and
avoid mistakes.  Verbose, repetitive code is error-prone and **evil!**
When writing your program try to comment as much as possible.
Format the code consistently.  It is much easier for your TA and the
professor to help you if we can quickly figure out what your code does.
